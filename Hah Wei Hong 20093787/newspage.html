        <img src="risks-of-artificial-intelligence.png" width="300px" height="200px">
        <p> 
          The voices warning against AI's present and potential pitfalls are becoming more and more audible as it becomes more 
          sophisticated and pervasive. Unease abounds on many fronts, including the growing automation of some jobs, gender and 
          racial bias problems resulting from outdated information sources, and autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight 
          (to name a few). And the process is still very young.

        <h2> What is Sustainable Living?</h2>
        <img src="sustainableliving.png" width="300px" height="200px">
        <p> 
          Sustainable living is a way of life and a philosophy. The term is as widely used as it is complex. Famous campaigners, NGOs, 
          and lifestyle bloggers promote it, and it is promoted in marketing and advertising for anything from cotton t-shirts to water-saving showerheads. 
          What does it actually mean, though? Living sustainably, in general, is making decisions and acting in ways that promote the wellbeing of both
          people and the environment while staying within our means.

        <h2> How to Stop Climate Change</h2>
        <img src="climatechange.png" width="300px" height="200px">
        <p>
          More than we can imagine, the effects of climate change are already being felt on our globe. All throughout the planet, temperatures are rising, and 
          we are seeing unprecedented shifts in precipitation patterns. Pollution is the primary factor contributing to these terrible repercussions on our world.
          We can always take action to combat climate change, which is a blessing. It is our duty to take action against these dreadful developments in order to 
          protect the earth for coming generations. Saving the environment begins with us.
